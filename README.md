# schiphol-gym
This repository contains some experiments related to building environments to simulate certain processes around Schiphol Airport.

Currently only experiments related to taxi routing are implemented. This process involves airplanes that arrive on a runway and need to go to a gate or that need to go from a gate to runway to take off.

This repository is purely based on open sources and knowledge. It is my own work and  unrelated to my affiliation to Schiphol Airport. 

The goal of this repository is to show how easily open sources can be used to create simulations of certain processes to be used in e.g. reinforcement learning. However, as you may have noticed this repository is provided without a Licence. This is done intentionally for now. If you want to use this code, contact me first.
